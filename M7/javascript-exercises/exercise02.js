// SUMMER CAMP
// Campers at summer camp can choose one of three afternoon activities:
// swimming, archery, or pottery.
// Swimmers must use the buddy system. If there's not an even number of swimmers,
// swimming is canceled and swimmers are reallocated to archery and pottery with
// the following rules:
// - add swimmers to the activity with the least participants until numbers are even
// - then distribute swimmers evenly, starting with pottery first.
// If there are an even number of swimmers, everyone gets their preferred activity.
