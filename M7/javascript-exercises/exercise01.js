// MANAGER FEATURE REQUESTS
// You have three managers: A, B, and C.
// Occasionally, they ask you to add features to your company software.
// Use if/else statements to enforce the following rules:
// - If all three ask for the feature, print "Feature in progress."
// - If any two of the three ask, print "Adding feature to schedule."
// - If only one of the three ask, print "Going to hold off for a bit."
// - If none of the managers ask, print "Nothing to do..."

const managerCAsked = true;

// 1. Add decisions statements to cover all scenarios.
// 2. Change manager variables to test all scenarios.
